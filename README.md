# üêû How to Count Bugs: A Quantitative Approach to Insect Population Estimation  

## üìå Overview  
The importance of **conservation and pest management programs** cannot be overstated as climate change, biodiversity loss, and biological invasions continue to rise. Such programs often rely on **traps** for population detection, monitoring, and evaluating treatment efficacy.  

In this project, we propose a **universal method** for estimating the most probable **absolute population density** from a single trap catch, along with its statistical bounds. This approach aims to bring **rigor and precision** to insect detection and monitoring efforts.  

## üî¨ Why It Matters  
- Provides a **scientifically grounded** method for estimating population density.  
- Can be applied to **any insect-trap system**.  
- Helps inform **conservation and pest control strategies** with quantitative data.  

## ‚úÖ Current Progress  
‚úî Developed an analytical model for insect population estimation.  
‚úî Tested with real-world trap data.  
‚úî Established statistical bounds for improved accuracy.  
‚úî Validated the method against existing techniques.  

## üìå Future Directions  
- Exploring further applications for conservation and pest management.  
- Refining model parameters for different environmental conditions.  
- Publishing findings and making the method more accessible.
